    <p>Welcome to the CollabOS website! This website contains information & links related to CollabOS.</p>
        <h2>About CollabOS</h2>
            <p>
                CollabOS is an "Operating System" made on Scratch.
                Scratch is a website made primarily for kids where people can drag around "blocks" on the screen to create code.
                The CollabOS project is a collaboration between many users to create and add features to an OS simulator.
                Many people have contributed to CollabOS, but some have since left.
                The CollabOS project was started by scratch user "elinero" in mid- to late-2019.
            </p>
