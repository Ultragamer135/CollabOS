    <h1>About CollabOS</h1>
        <h2>The basics</h2>
            <p>
                CollabOS is an "Operating System" made on Scratch.
                Scratch is a website made primarily for kids where people can drag around "blocks" on the screen to create code.
                The CollabOS project is a collaboration between many scratch users to create and add features to an OS simulator.
                Many people have contributed to CollabOS, but some have since left.
                CollabOS is inspired by OS wars on scratch, but everyone works together.
                Some members of the CollabOS project are pushing the limits of scratch, doing things such as creating encrypted chat rooms and cloud systems.
            </p>
        <h2>How CollabOS was started</h2>
            <p>
                Back in mid- to late-2019, Scratcher `elinero` created a forum thread on the Scratch Collaboration Forums, looking to recruit members for a project inspired by OSWars called CollabOS, where people would sign up to add new features to an OS simulator on Scratch. 
                Membership was relatively low, but soon rose very quickly, with 14 collaborators within the project's official development studio, ranging from `mlcreater` to `Prokube` and `wamu_m`.
                Many more had contributed to the project, but have since left.
            </p>
        <h2>Notable achievement's</h2>
            <p>
                Many things have been accomplished during the CollabOS project, some big and some small.
                Some of the bigger things that have been made include:
                <ul style="text-align: left; display: table; margin: 0 auto;">
                    <li>A full cloud login system</li>
                    <li>An encrypted chat room</li>
                    <li>A programming language</li>
                    <li>A small video sharing platform</li>
                    <li>Multiple good logo's</li>
                    <li>And more!</li>
                </ul>
