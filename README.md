# CollabOS
An OS by Scratchers, for Scratchers.

## About Us
Back in mid- to late-2019, Scratcher `elinero` created a forum thread on the Scratch Collaboration Forums, looking to recruit members for a project inspired by OSWars called CollabOS, where people would sign up to add new features to an OS emulator on Scratch. Membership was relatively low, but soon rose very quickly, with 14 collaborators within the project's official development studio, ranging from `mlcreater` to `Prokube` and `wamu_m`. Many more had contributed to the project, but have since left.

Using some extremely complex coding wizardry several active contributors are currently making cloud systems and encrypted chatroom's, things that break the bounds of what was meant to be an introductory coding language for primary school children.
